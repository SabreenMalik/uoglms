# Browser Extension Setup

Setting up browser extensions for Edge or Chrome is a simple process. This guide will walk you through the steps to set up the extension on your local machine.

1. First, you need to get the extension files on your local machine. You can do this by either downloading the repository as a ZIP file or [cloning](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository) it.

   - ## Download as ZIP

   1. Click on the 'Code' button on the repository page.
   2. Select 'Download ZIP'.
   3. Once downloaded, extract the ZIP file to your desired location.

   - ## Clone the Repository

   1. Click on the 'Code' button on the repository page.
   2. Copy the URL provided.
   3. Open a terminal/command prompt.
   4. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
   5. Run the command `git clone https://github.com/najmiter/darkcircles.git`

2) After you have the files, you can proceed with the extension setup.

   - ## For Edge

   1. Open Microsoft Edge and go to the 'Extensions' page or navigate to (edge://extensions/).
   2. Enable 'Developer mode' at the bottom of the page.
   3. Click on 'Load unpacked' and select the extension directory.

   - ## For Chrome

   1. Open Google Chrome and go to the 'Extensions' page or navigate to (chrome://extensions/).
   2. Enable 'Developer mode' at the top right of the page.
   3. Click on 'Load unpacked' and select the extension directory.

3) Navigate to [UOG LMS](https://lms.uog.edu.pk/) and log in to your account and see the extension in action.

## Graphical Demonstration
It's a very simple 3 steps setup to get going.

1. Go to the three dots in the right top corner of Chrome browser and select `Extensions` then `Manage Extensions`.
